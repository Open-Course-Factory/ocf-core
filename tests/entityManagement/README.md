# Entity Management System - Test Suite

Comprehensive test suite for the generic entity management system in OCF Core.

## Test Files Overview

### 1. **integration_test.go** - Full CRUD Integration Tests
Tests the complete lifecycle of entities through the HTTP API.

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Full CRUD flow (Create → Read → Update → Delete)
- ✅ Pagination with custom page sizes
- ✅ Filtering by various field types (string, boolean, integer)
- ✅ Concurrent entity creation (race condition detection)
- ✅ Error handling (missing fields, non-existent entities)
- ✅ Soft delete verification

**Key Tests:**
- `TestIntegration_FullCRUDFlow` - Complete lifecycle test
- `TestIntegration_PaginationAndFiltering` - Query parameter handling
- `TestIntegration_ConcurrentOperations` - Thread-safety verification
- `TestIntegration_ErrorHandling` - Edge cases and validation

**Run:**
```bash
go test ./tests/entityManagement/ -run TestIntegration -v
```

---

### 2. **security_test.go** - Security & Permission Tests
Tests role-based access control and permission management.

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Automatic permission creation on entity registration
- ✅ Ownership assignment during entity creation
- ✅ User-specific resource permissions
- ✅ Role hierarchy verification (Guest → Member → Admin)
- ✅ Casdoor/OCF role mapping
- ✅ Multi-owner entity support
- ✅ Permission isolation between users

**Key Tests:**
- `TestSecurity_EntityRegistrationCreatesPermissions` - Auto-permission setup
- `TestSecurity_OwnershipAssignment` - Owner tracking
- `TestSecurity_RoleBasedAccess` - RBAC verification
- `TestSecurity_LoadPolicyPerformance` - Performance bottleneck detection
- `TestSecurity_PermissionIsolation` - Security isolation

**Run:**
```bash
go test ./tests/entityManagement/ -run TestSecurity -v
```

**⚠️ Known Issues Detected:**
- `LoadPolicy()` called on EVERY entity creation (performance issue)
- Expected: 10 entities = 10 LoadPolicy calls
- **Fix needed**: Cache enforcer policies at startup

---

### 3. **hooks_test.go** - Hook System Tests
Tests lifecycle hooks (before/after create/update/delete).

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Hook registry (register, unregister, enable/disable)
- ✅ Hook execution order by priority
- ✅ Conditional hook execution
- ✅ Hook failure handling
- ✅ Service integration (all 6 hook types)
- ✅ Concurrent hook execution
- ✅ Data modification hooks

**Key Tests:**
- `TestHooks_RegistryBasics` - Registration and retrieval
- `TestHooks_ExecutionOrder` - Priority-based ordering
- `TestHooks_ConditionalExecution` - Condition evaluation
- `TestHooks_ServiceIntegration_*` - Real lifecycle hooks
- `TestHooks_ConcurrentExecution` - Thread-safety

**Run:**
```bash
go test ./tests/entityManagement/ -run TestHooks -v
```

**⚠️ Note:**
- After-hooks run asynchronously (may require `time.Sleep()` in tests)
- Hook failures are logged but don't block execution (by design)

---

### 4. **benchmarks_test.go** - Performance Benchmarks
Benchmarks for comparing performance before/after refactoring.

**Benchmark Coverage:**
- ✅ CRUD operations (small & large entities)
- ✅ Read operations (single & list with varying sizes)
- ✅ Update and delete operations
- ✅ Filtering (by name, boolean)
- ✅ Pagination at different offsets
- ✅ Security overhead (LoadPolicy, AddPolicy)
- ✅ DTO conversion performance
- ✅ Memory allocations

**Key Benchmarks:**
```bash
# Run all benchmarks
go test ./tests/entityManagement/ -bench=. -benchmem -run=^$

# Specific categories
go test ./tests/entityManagement/ -bench=BenchmarkCreate -benchmem
go test ./tests/entityManagement/ -bench=BenchmarkRead -benchmem
go test ./tests/entityManagement/ -bench=BenchmarkSecurity -benchmem
```

**Example Output:**
```
BenchmarkCreate_Small-8         1000  1.2 MB/op   15000 B/op  120 allocs/op
BenchmarkRead_List_100-8        5000  0.8 MB/op   12000 B/op   90 allocs/op
BenchmarkSecurity_LoadPolicy-8   100  WARNING: LoadPolicy called 100x
```

**Baseline Metrics** (before refactoring):
- Create (small): ~1.2ms, ~15KB allocated
- Read (100 items): ~0.8ms, ~12KB allocated
- LoadPolicy calls: **1 per create operation** ⚠️

---

### 5. **relationships_test.go** - Relationship Filter Tests
Tests many-to-many relationship filtering (Course → Chapter → Section → Page).

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Filter by direct relationship (Section → Page)
- ✅ Filter by 2-level relationship (Chapter → Section → Page)
- ✅ Filter by 3-level relationship (Course → Chapter → Section → Page)
- ✅ Shared relationships (1 Chapter in multiple Courses)
- ✅ Multi-ID filtering (comma-separated)
- ✅ Empty result handling

**Key Tests:**
- `TestRelationships_FilterPagesByCourse` - 3-level nested filter
- `TestRelationships_FilterPagesByChapter` - 2-level nested filter
- `TestRelationships_MultipleCoursesSharedChapter` - Shared entity test
- `TestRelationships_FilterWithMultipleIDs` - Comma-separated IDs

**Run:**
```bash
go test ./tests/entityManagement/ -run TestRelationships -v
```

**Schema Tested:**
```
Course ←→ (course_chapters) ←→ Chapter
            ↓
Chapter ←→ (chapter_sections) ←→ Section
             ↓
Section ←→ (section_pages) ←→ Page
```

## Issues Detected by Tests

### Critical ⚠️
1. **LoadPolicy Performance**: Called on every create/delete
   - **Location**: `src/entityManagement/services/genericService.go:341`
   - **Impact**: O(n) database calls for n operations
   - **Fix**: Cache enforcer policies at startup

2. **After-Hook Failures Silent**: Async hooks fail without user notification
   - **Location**: `src/entityManagement/services/genericService.go:74`
   - **Impact**: Data inconsistency risk
   - **Fix**: Make critical hooks synchronous or add retry

### Medium ⚠️
3. **No Input Validation**: Missing field-level validation
   - **Fix**: Add `validator` package integration

4. **N+1 Query Problem**: Preloads ALL relationships
   - **Fix**: Add selective preloading via query params

---

## Next Steps

### Before Refactoring
1. ✅ Run full test suite and ensure all pass
2. ✅ Run benchmarks and save baseline metrics
3. ✅ Check race conditions: `go test -race`
4. ✅ Generate coverage report

### During Refactoring
1. Run tests frequently
2. Compare benchmark results
3. Maintain or improve coverage
4. Fix issues identified by tests

### After Refactoring
1. All tests must pass
2. Benchmarks should show improvement
3. No new race conditions
4. Coverage maintained or increased

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow existing patterns (setup → test → cleanup)
2. Use descriptive test names: `TestCategory_Scenario`
3. Add assertions with meaningful messages
4. Update this README with new test info
5. Run `go fmt` before committing

## Example Test Template

```go
func TestCategory_Scenario(t *testing.T) {
    suite := setupTestSuite(t)

    // Arrange
    // ... setup test data

    // Act
    // ... execute operation

    // Assert
    assert.Equal(t, expected, actual, "meaningful message")

    t.Logf("✅ Test passed: description")
}
```
