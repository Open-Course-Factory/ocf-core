# System Explainer

Get a comprehensive explanation of how a system or feature works.

## What I'll Do

1. **Ask what to explain:**
   - A specific feature (e.g., "terminal sharing")
   - A system (e.g., "payment system")
   - A pattern (e.g., "entity registration")
   - A file or function

2. **Use Explore agent** to find all relevant code

3. **Provide structured explanation:**
   - **Purpose**: What it does and why
   - **Architecture**: How it's structured
   - **Data Flow**: Step-by-step execution
   - **Key Files**: Where the code lives (with line numbers)
   - **Dependencies**: What it relies on
   - **Integration Points**: How other systems use it
   - **Edge Cases**: Special behaviors to know

4. **Visual representation:**
   - Sequence diagrams (as text)
   - Data structure diagrams
   - Flow charts

5. **Code examples:**
   - How to use it
   - Common patterns
   - Related implementations

6. **Related documentation:**
   - Link to .claude/docs files
   - Swagger endpoints
   - Test examples

## Example Topics

- "How does terminal sharing work?"
- "Explain the entity registration system"
- "How do subscription limits work?"
- "Explain the permission system"
- "How does bulk import work?"
- "Explain the organization hierarchy"

I'll give you a complete mental model of the system!
