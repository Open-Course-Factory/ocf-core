## 📚 Documentation Roadmap

### Day 1 (Essential - 20 minutes)
1. `.claude/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (5 min)
2. `.claude/MCP_QUICKSTART.md` (5 min)
3. Try `/pre-commit` command
4. Install MCPs

### Week 1 (Foundation - 2 hours)
1. `.claude/AGENTS_GUIDE.md` (15 min)
2. `.claude/commands/REVIEW_AGENTS_README.md` (15 min)
3. Practice with Bronze level commands

## 🎯 Mastery Levels

### 🥉 Bronze (Week 1)
- `/pre-commit` before every commit
- `/test` when code changes
- `/api-test` for quick testing
- **Goal:** Build muscle memory

### 🥈 Silver (Week 2-4)
- `/review-pr` before PRs
- `/security-scan` proactively
- `/new-entity` for scaffolding
- **Goal:** Ship 2x faster

### 🥇 Gold (Month 2)
- Weekly `/enforce-patterns`
- Monthly `/improve` sessions
- `/performance-audit` optimization
- **Goal:** 90%+ code quality

### 💎 Platinum (Quarter 1)
- All agents regularly
- Custom commands created
- MCP-enhanced workflows
- **Goal:** World-class quality

---

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Daily Development
```
Morning:
- Pull latest code
- /enforce-patterns (check for issues)

During development:
- Write code
- /api-test (test endpoints)
- /test (run tests)

Before commit:
- /pre-commit ⭐ (comprehensive check)
- Commit

Before PR:
- /review-pr (full review)
- Push
```

### Example 2: With MCPs
```
You: "Show me all organizations with expired subscriptions"
Me: [PostgreSQL MCP] → Direct query → Results in 5 seconds

You: "Check postgres logs from last 10 minutes"
Me: [Docker MCP] → Container logs → Issues identified

You: "Who wrote the payment webhook handler?"
Me: [Git MCP] → Commit history → Author found
```

# Create a new command
nano .claude/commands/my-command.md

# Add frontmatter and instructions
---
description: What this command does
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---

# Instructions for Claude...
```

### Extend MCP Integration
```json
// Add to mcp-config.json
{
  "my-custom-mcp": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["@my-scope/my-mcp"]
  }
}
```

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Weekly Metrics
Track these every Monday:
- Pattern Compliance % (via `/enforce-patterns`)
- Test Coverage % (via `/test`)
- Security Score (via `/security-scan`)
- Performance Score (via `/performance-audit`)

### Quality Dashboard
```
Week 1: 65% → 70% → 75%
Week 2: 75% → 80% → 85%
Week 3: 85% → 90% → 92%
Week 4: 92% → 94% → 95% ✅
```

## 🚨 Important Reminders

1. **Run `/pre-commit` before EVERY commit** - Make it muscle memory!
2. **Run `/review-pr` before pushing** - Catch issues early
3. **Weekly `/enforce-patterns`** - Maintain consistency
4. **Monthly `/improve`** - Continuous improvement
5. **Install MCPs** - 10x productivity boost

## 📞 Getting Help

### If Commands Don't Work
1. Type `/` to see available commands
2. Or just ask naturally: "Review my code"
3. I'll understand and use the right agent

### If MCPs Aren't Loading
1. Check: `bash .claude/install-mcps.sh`
2. Verify: Configuration in Claude Code settings
3. Restart: Claude Code
4. Test: Ask "What MCPs do you have?"

## 🎁 Bonus Features

### Agent + MCP Combinations
- `/review-pr` + PostgreSQL → Verify schema changes
- `/security-scan` + Database → Check actual queries
- `/performance-audit` + PostgreSQL → Analyze query performance
- `/debug-test` + Docker → Check container logs

### Context-Aware Usage
Just describe what you did:
- "I added payment webhooks"
- "I refactored the organization service"
- "I'm seeing slow database queries"

I'll automatically suggest the right agents/MCPs to use!
