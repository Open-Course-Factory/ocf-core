## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Parallel Agent Execution
```bash
# Run multiple agents at once
You: "Full quality check"
Me: [Spawns /review-pr + /security-scan + /performance-audit in parallel]
```

**Benefit:** 3x faster than sequential

---

### Tip 2: Context-Aware Agent Usage
```bash
# Just describe what you did
You: "I added payment webhooks"
Me: [Automatically suggests /security-scan + /test + /review-pr]
```

**Benefit:** Right checks at the right time

---

### Tip 3: Agent Chaining
```bash
# One command triggers others
/pre-commit â†’ Detects violations â†’ Auto-runs /refactor â†’ Applies fixes â†’ Re-runs /test
```

**Benefit:** Automated quality loops

---

### Tip 4: Custom Agent Creation
```bash
# Create project-specific agents
nano .claude/commands/deploy-check.md

# Use it!
/deploy-check
```

**Benefit:** Tailored to your workflow

---

### Tip 5: Agent Learning
```bash
# Agents learn your patterns
/enforce-patterns (Week 1) â†’ 45 violations
/enforce-patterns (Week 4) â†’ 5 violations

# Agents adapt to your style
```

**Benefit:** Increasingly relevant feedback

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Measuring Success

### Code Quality Metrics

**Track these with agents:**

```
Week 1 Baseline:
- Pattern Compliance: 65%
- Test Coverage: 75%
- Security Score: 70/100
- Performance Score: 60/100

Week 8 Target:
- Pattern Compliance: 95%
- Test Coverage: 90%
- Security Score: 95/100
- Performance Score: 85/100
```

**How to track:**
```bash
# Weekly quality report
/enforce-patterns â†’ Note compliance %
/test â†’ Check coverage %
/security-scan â†’ Note security score
/performance-audit â†’ Note performance score
```

### Time Savings Estimate

**Without Agents:**
- Manual code review: 30 min
- Finding patterns: 20 min
- Security checks: 30 min
- Performance testing: 20 min
- Test debugging: 40 min
- Documentation: 15 min
**Total:** ~2.5 hours per feature

**With Agents:**
- `/review-pr`: 3 min
- `/find-pattern`: 1 min
- `/security-scan`: 2 min
- `/performance-audit`: 2 min
- `/test`: 1 min
- `/update-docs`: 30 sec
**Total:** ~10 minutes per feature

**Savings:** 2+ hours per feature Ã— 5 features/week = **10 hours/week**
