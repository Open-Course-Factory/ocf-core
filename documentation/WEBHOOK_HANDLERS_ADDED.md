# Webhook Handlers Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ All Handlers Implemented

All webhook handlers requested in `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_CONFIGURATION.md` have been successfully added to the codebase.

---

## What Was Added

### 1. Subscription Pause/Resume Handlers

**Events:** `customer.subscription.paused`, `customer.subscription.resumed`

**Functionality:**
- `handleSubscriptionPaused()`: Updates subscription status to "paused" in database
- `handleSubscriptionResumed()`: Reactivates subscription, updates status from Stripe

**Use Case:** When Stripe pauses collection (e.g., failed payment retry), your database stays in sync

---

### 2. Trial Expiration Warning

**Event:** `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`

**Functionality:**
- `handleTrialWillEnd()`: Logs trial ending date
- Ready for notification integration (email, webhook, etc.)

**Use Case:** Send "Your trial ends in 3 days" notifications to users

**TODO:** Add email/notification service integration

---

### 3. Invoice Lifecycle Tracking

**Events:** `invoice.created`, `invoice.finalized`

**Functionality:**
- `handleInvoiceCreated()`: Creates invoice record when Stripe generates invoice (draft/open)
- `handleInvoiceFinalized()`: Updates invoice when finalized and ready for payment

**Use Case:**
- Users can see upcoming/pending invoices before payment
- Better invoice history and tracking
- Show "Invoice pending" vs "Invoice paid" states

**Before:** Only paid invoices appeared in database
**After:** All invoices tracked from creation through payment

---

### 4. Payment Method Sync

**Events:** `payment_method.attached`, `payment_method.detached`

**Functionality:**
- `handlePaymentMethodAttached()`: Creates payment method record when user adds card
- `handlePaymentMethodDetached()`: Marks payment method as inactive when removed

**Use Case:**
- Automatic sync when users add/remove cards in Stripe
- Keeps payment methods table up-to-date
- Preserves history (soft delete - marks as inactive instead of deleting)

**Details:**
- Supports card details (brand, last 4 digits, expiration)
- Automatically links to user via customer ID
- Handles cases where customer doesn't have subscription yet

---

### 5. Customer Data Sync

**Event:** `customer.updated`

**Functionality:**
- `handleCustomerUpdated()`: Syncs customer ID changes
- Ready for email/name sync to Casdoor

**Use Case:**
- When customer data changes in Stripe Dashboard
- Keeps customer references up-to-date

**TODO:** Add Casdoor email/name synchronization if needed

---

## Build Status

‚úÖ **All code compiles successfully**
‚úÖ **No errors or warnings**
‚úÖ **Ready for deployment**

```bash
go build ./...
# Success - no errors
```

---

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Each Webhook in Stripe Dashboard

Go to **Developers ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your endpoint ‚Üí Send test webhook**

Test these new handlers:
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.paused`
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.resumed`
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`
- ‚úÖ `invoice.created`
- ‚úÖ `invoice.finalized`
- ‚úÖ `payment_method.attached`
- ‚úÖ `payment_method.detached`
- ‚úÖ `customer.updated`

### 2. Check Logs

After sending test webhooks, verify logs show:

```
üì• Received webhook event: payment_method.attached (ID: evt_xxx)
üí≥ Processing payment method attached
üí≥ Creating payment method pm_xxx for user user-id (type: card, card: 4242)
‚úÖ Successfully processed webhook event evt_xxx
```

### 3. Database Verification

After testing, check tables:
- `payment_methods` - New entries for attached payment methods
- `invoices` - Draft/open invoices created before payment
- `user_subscriptions` - Status changes for pause/resume

---

## Logging Examples

Each handler includes detailed logging for debugging:

**Subscription Paused:**
```
‚è∏Ô∏è Subscription sub_xxx paused for user user-id
```

**Payment Method Added:**
```
üí≥ Creating payment method pm_xxx for user user-id (type: card, card: 4242)
```

**Invoice Created:**
```
üìÑ Creating invoice INV-0001 for user user-id (status: draft, amount: 2999 eur)
```

**Trial Warning:**
```
‚è∞ Trial will end for user user-id on 2025-10-10 (subscription: sub_xxx)
```

---

## What's Not Included (Future Enhancements)

### Notification System Integration

**Current:** Handlers log events
**Future:** Send actual notifications

**Example:**
```go
// In handleTrialWillEnd()
// TODO: Send email notification
notificationService.SendEmail(userSub.UserID, "trial_ending", map[string]interface{}{
    "end_date": trialEndDate,
    "user_name": user.Name,
})
```

### Casdoor Customer Sync

**Current:** Customer updates are logged
**Future:** Sync email/name changes to Casdoor

**Example:**
```go
// In handleCustomerUpdated()
// TODO: Sync to Casdoor
if customer.Email != "" {
    casdoorsdk.UpdateUser(&casdoorsdk.User{
        Id: userSub.UserID,
        Email: customer.Email,
    })
}
```
